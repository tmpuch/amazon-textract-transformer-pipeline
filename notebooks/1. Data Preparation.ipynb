    "\n",
    "# Part 1: Introduction and Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "> *This notebook works well with the `Data Science 3.0 (Python 3)` kernel on SageMaker Studio*\n",
    "\n",
    "Human-readable documents are more than just 1D sequences of text: Many have **complex layout and formatting structures** (like headers and footers, form fields, tables, paragraphs and multi-section layouts...) that are important for a wide range of information extraction tasks - and challenge the idea that pages always have one \"correct reading order\" at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-modal, layout-aware language models** - like [**DocFormer** (2021, Appalaraju et al at AWS AI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11539), [**LayoutXLM** (2021, Xu et al)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08836), and the LayoutLM series [v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13318), [v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14740), [v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08387) - augment traditional (sequence-based) text processing models to add features representing the **absolute positions of words/tokens on the page**: And other modalities too, like a pixel image representation of the source page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architectures like these can **significantly improve accuracy** (over plain text methods or position-based templating), for information extraction tasks where *both* the visual layout and the text content are useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Note:** You should be aware that several fully-managed document AI service offerings on AWS, are already capable of similar kinds of multi-modal document understanding under the hood: Particularly [Amazon Textract Queries](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/amazon-textract-launches-queries-feature-analyze-document-api/) and [Amazon Comprehend native document processing](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/amazon-comprehend-extract-entities-native-format/).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> While these AI services should usually be the first choice where available, custom SageMaker-based modelling as shown here may still be of interest in some cases: For example if you'd like to customize the model architeture or pre-training, or use a particular feature+language combination that's not currently available as a managed service.\n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-modal approach is useful for post-processing OCR results from services like [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) (which returns both the detected text and the geometry of each word in the input document), and can be compatible with a broad range of downstream NLP tasks, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Self-supervised\" pre-training on Textracted but otherwise unlabelled documents\n",
    "- Classifying documents, pages, or individual lines/sequences\n",
    "- Extracting entities (e.g. via token/word classification)\n",
    "- Extractive question answering and other span extraction tasks\n",
    "- \"Translation\", generative question answering or other sequence generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample we'll demonstrate applying open-source models in this family (including the multi-lingual **[LayoutXLM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/layoutxlm)** and English-optimized **LayoutLM [v1](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/layoutlm)/[v2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/layoutlmv2)**) to an example use case where Amazon Textract's [built-in functionality](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/features/) for extracting key-value \"Forms\" data and structured \"Tables\" data helps somewhat... But would require further post-processing for usable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Note:** Although model implementations in the [Hugging Face Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) used by this sample are generally published under the permissive Apache-2.0 license [as detailed on their GitHub repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/LICENSE), you should be aware that **license terms for pre-trained model weights** published on the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) may vary. In particular, there is [a difference](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/issues/352) in commercial-use licensing between pre-trained LayoutLMv1 and v2/v3/XLM weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first notebook will focus on preparing and annotating data, before we move on to training, deploying, and integrating models in later notebooks."

    "## Data prep overview (⚙️ bringing your own data)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers 3 main data preparation steps for training multi-modal document understanding models like these:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Processing raw documents with **Amazon Textract** to extract position-linked text information.\n",
    "1. **Cleaning** document images ready for human annotation (and, for some models, preparing standard-sized page images).\n",
    "1. **Iteratively annotating** documents to build a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll try to keep this process **modular** to make it easy to adapt for your own datasets and iterate as your corpus grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, we'll use [JSONLines](https://jsonlines.org/) formatted [augmented manifest files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/augmented-manifest.html#augmented-manifest-format) as a shared integration point: Starting out with a simple document-level list of raw files, and gradually building up to an annotated, page-level manifest with records something like the below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"raw-ref\": \"s3://doc-example-bucket/raw/mydoc.pdf\", \"textract-ref\": \"s3://doc-example-bucket/tex/mydoc.pdf.json\", \"page-num\": 2, \"source-ref\": \"s3://doc-example-bucket/img/mydoc-0002.png\", \"labels\": {...}}\n",
    "{\"raw-ref\": \"s3://doc-example-bucket/raw/mydoc.pdf\", \"textract-ref\": \"s3://doc-example-bucket/tex/mydoc.pdf.json\", \"page-num\": 3, \"source-ref\": \"s3://doc-example-bucket/img/mydoc-0003.png\", \"labels\": {...}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your setup deviates at any step (for example, already having Textract results for your documents) or you want to modify the data, then so long as you're able to generate the manifest file output for each step, you should be able to continue the flow. "

    "## Defining the challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "We have our source documents, so what will we try to extract about them?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways position-aware NLP models might be applied to OCR outputs: For example to generate structured summaries, provide translations, answer questions, or just classify the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common requirement in document analytics and process automation though, is to extract particular **'fields' of interest**: Known attributes expected to be present in all/most of the documents, which would be interesting to compare between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we'll tackle this as an **entity detection** task **via word classification**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining a list of field/entity types of interest\n",
    "- Classifying each `WORD` in the document to these types, using a Hugging Face [LayoutLMv2ForTokenClassification](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/layoutlmv2#transformers.LayoutLMv2ForTokenClassification) model or similar\n",
    "- ...And finally grouping individual words together (via simple rule-based post-processing) to detect the entities/fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Some **benefits** of this approach are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Results are traceable all the way back to the detected word blocks from the OCR engine; rather than with a text generation method where the output of the model may not correspond 1:1 with raw text.\n",
    "- Annotation effort is relatively minimal; since we only need to highlight the documents, rather than typing out custom corrections, answers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some **drawbacks** are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since it only tags detected words, this model will not be able to *intelligently correct OCR errors* or *standardize form* (e.g. of dates) like a text generation method could learn to.\n",
    "- Since the ML component only extends to word classification, we're still relying on (usually good, helped by Amazon Textract) rule-based heuristics to group same-type words together to detect multi-word entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we'll define the set of fields/entities to be detected and their configuration aspects. You can run `help(FieldConfiguration)` or refer to [util/postproc/config.py](util/postproc/config.py) for more details of the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Warning:** Although you may **edit** the configuration below (to build a custom dataset), you'll no longer be able to use the pre-annotated data sample we provide in `data/annotations` to accelerate model training (unless the classes are still defined in the same order, and labelled in a consistent way with the previous guidelines)"
