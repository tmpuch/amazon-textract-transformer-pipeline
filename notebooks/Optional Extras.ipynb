    "After updating your pipeline's field configuration SSM parameter to set `normalizer_endpoint` and `normalizer_prompt` on your target entity types, your pipeline's Post-processing Lambda function should automatically start calling your SageMaker model endpoints to normalize mentions on the relevant fields. For example with the Credit Card Agreements sample data, you should see that `Agreement Effective Date` results start to show in `YYYY-MM-DD` format instead of the document's source format, when reviewing results in Amazon A2I or the Step Functions console.\n",
